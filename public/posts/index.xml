      <description>The countdown to the departure across the atlantic has begun. There is just 6 days to go before we set off on the first proper leg of our adventure. All three of us are now in Las Palmas working through the to do list, attending seminars and filling the boat with enough food to feed a small army. There is a surreal bubble around Las Palmas with around 70 boats all raiding the local chandlers for missing bits of kit and deciding how much vaccum packed meat to get delivered from the local butcher.</description>

      <description>OK, so images can get quite complicated as we have a few variables to work with! For example the image below has had a caption entered in the WordPress image upload dialog box, this creates a [caption] shortcode which then in turn wraps the whole thing in a div with inline styling! Maybe one day they&#39;ll be able to use the figure and figcaption elements for all this. Additionally, images can be wrapped in links which, if you&#39;re using anything other than color or text-decoration to style your links can be problematic.</description>

      <description>Propulit demit sinus et dea omnia placandam Fornace quibus forma Lorem markdownum, tantique rebellant dedisse. Me Lelex iam sui ereptamque idem, pervenit in circumdata quoque pollentibus Nereides est. Tendunt habeo pictasque suorum vestra, nam est pectora signa.
 Quod Mysum nescitve ventis pericula signa Tibi frequentes erroribus docendam dubitatis Per essem tantum poscor Non erat quo omnia est Micantes acies  Huic quas frigus crinalem Nec ignibus; mortale Liber exsiluisse munere.</description>
