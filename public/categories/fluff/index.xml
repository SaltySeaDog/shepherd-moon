      <description>OK, so images can get quite complicated as we have a few variables to work with! For example the image below has had a caption entered in the WordPress image upload dialog box, this creates a [caption] shortcode which then in turn wraps the whole thing in a div with inline styling! Maybe one day they&#39;ll be able to use the figure and figcaption elements for all this. Additionally, images can be wrapped in links which, if you&#39;re using anything other than color or text-decoration to style your links can be problematic.</description>

      <description>Propulit demit sinus et dea omnia placandam Fornace quibus forma Lorem markdownum, tantique rebellant dedisse. Me Lelex iam sui ereptamque idem, pervenit in circumdata quoque pollentibus Nereides est. Tendunt habeo pictasque suorum vestra, nam est pectora signa.
 Quod Mysum nescitve ventis pericula signa Tibi frequentes erroribus docendam dubitatis Per essem tantum poscor Non erat quo omnia est Micantes acies  Huic quas frigus crinalem Nec ignibus; mortale Liber exsiluisse munere.</description>
