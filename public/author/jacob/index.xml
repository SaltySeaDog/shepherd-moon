      <description>OK, so images can get quite complicated as we have a few variables to work with! For example the image below has had a caption entered in the WordPress image upload dialog box, this creates a [caption] shortcode which then in turn wraps the whole thing in a div with inline styling! Maybe one day they&#39;ll be able to use the figure and figcaption elements for all this. Additionally, images can be wrapped in links which, if you&#39;re using anything other than color or text-decoration to style your links can be problematic.</description>
