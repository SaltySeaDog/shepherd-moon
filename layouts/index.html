                    Sailing around the world has been a life long ambition for Richard. It's only taken 40 years for this to become a reality. Finally retiring this autumn, he is a looking forward to swapping responsibility of managing his small team at work to managing a small crew at sea.

                    Vanessa was initially nervous about the idea of being abandoned alone in the middle of the ocean, she agreed to come on the circumnavigation if it was done in the company of others. Hence the reason for joining the ARC and then the world ARC. On board Vanessa is mainly in charge of making sure the crew all have enough to eat and countering some of Richard's slight more reckless tendancies.

Not content to have the rest of the family have all the fun though, Daisy demanded that she should be included too.

            <p>
             <em>Shepherd Moon</em> (previously <em>MAIA II</em>) is a Hallberg Rassy 46 that will be in charge of whisking us around the world. Build in 2003, she was recently retrofitted to transform her into a proper ocean going vessel. By the time we picked her up in June 2017 she looked like a totally different boat. However given that we had added a hard top and an inner forstay this might of not been that suprising. Lets hope she treats us well over the coming years.

                A Shepherd Moon is a small moon that clears a gap in a planets ring. The name is a result of the fact they herd the ring particles like a shepherd. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/pia21893/daphnis-final-appearance/">NASA has a nice photograph of them in action</a>

                The name <em>Shepherd Moon</em> has a number of more personal connections behind it. First it is the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd_Moons">Enya's Third Studio Album</a> that Vanessa played to the tiny Jacob and slightly less Daisy when they were Babies. Also the name of the first boat that Vanessa sailed on was called New Moon, and was also the name of the boat that Richard and Vanessa met on (different boat, same name). Finally the shepherding aspect is quite appropriate as for many years we herded sheep on our smallholding.
