Over the summer we have sailed Shepherd Moon from 58 degrees North to 
our current latitude of 16 degrees North with the single aim of putting 
ourselves comfortably in the tradewind belt. The winds that drove 
commerce for the centuries before Amazon turned up and made us think 
that even next day delivery is a bit tardy (OK, so there was a bit of a 
gap between the days of sail and Amazon but a bit of artistic licence 
never goes amiss). So here we are, smack bang in the middle of the 
tradewind belt and all we have is a mere zephyr of a breeze. For the 
past 24 hours we have been sailing at between 4 or 5 knots, which given 
the wind is only 7 to 8 knots is actually quite impressive, but it's 
not fast enough to get us to St Lucia in time for the Daisy-deadline.

The lack of wind has been matched by a lack of flying fish and whales. 
We have seen flying fish, although far fewer than on the passage to 
Cape Verde, but they just haven't turned up on the deck. This may be 
because we are flying the Blue Water Runner which keeps the boat more 
upright, and so should we intersect the flight path of any flying fish 
there are more likely to just thwack into the side of the boat rather 
than coming on board to join us. We were however visited by a huge pod 
of dolphins just as the sun was setting last night. Jacob was all for 
diving in and playing with them until I broke it to him gently that 
even the Michael Phelps would struggle to swim at 5 knots and if we 
stopped the boat, the dolphins would soon get bored and leave. They 
played under the bow of the boat for ages and then just as quickly as 
they arrived, they disappeared again.

The other key event of the past 24 hours is that Iceman finally 
succumbed to the tea towel, leaving Maverick as the sole survivor from 
our Mindelo fly infestation. The two of them spent much of yesterday 
taunting us with their acrobatic displays until Iceman flew too close 
to the sun. Maverick, however, has not been seen since last night and 
so he has either died of natural causes or headed off into the big blue 
yonder. Alternatively he may be sitting in a dark corner mourning the 
loss of his friend. In a strange, Stockholm syndrome in reverse kind of 
way, I'm actually rather missing them.

Anyway, we now have 1,780 nautical miles to go to St Lucia. Let's hope 
the tradewinds finally live up to their name so we can get there before 
Christmas!
