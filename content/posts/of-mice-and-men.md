We sent Jacob up the mast twice yesterday. The first time he was armed with
a "mouse" made of fishing weights. We had high hopes
that this would have sufficient mass to pull the mousing line down to the
bottom of the mast. Getting him to the top of the mast requires a
lot of winching, especially in the heat of the day, but it isn't as though
Jacob can just sit there in a sedan chair enjoying the view. He has
to try and stop himself swinging wildly into the rigging and getting
tangled up in the plethora of wires, ropes and sticky out bits of metal,
some of which seem to be designed with the sole purpose of catching any
passing bit of rope and clinging on to it stubbornly. (I'm using
the word rope in its loosest sense. Sticklers for nomenclature would tell
you that the only piece of rope to be found on a sailing boat is the
one attached to the ships bell).

After much strenuous winching Jacob arrived at the top of the mast, only to
discover that his mouse was too fat to fit through its hole! The
sensible thing to do at that stage would have been to get him down and
rethink, but instead we thought we'd abandon the mousing line
altogether and try and force feed the halyard back down the mast. This
proved to be hopeless. All it achieved was a very seasick Jacob.
This time he was actually sick, but knowing how much his dad loves his new
teak decks, he was considerate enough to wait until the top
of the mast swung over the sea!

We got Jacob back down and decided to delay any further attempts until late
afternoon when the sun had lost some of its heat. In the
intervening period I made a new mouse out of four AA batteries taped into a
long, thin cylinder. The tape I used was blue and I was a bit
worried I wouldn't be able to see it inside the mast, and so I added some
yellow tape stripes. The end result was very aesthetically
pleasing, which, as we all know, is the most important thing. At around 5
o'clock we regrouped around the base of the mast and once
again winched Jacob up to the top. The multi-coloured mouse dropped through
the hole and headed downwards. As on the outside,
there are a whole host of sticky out bits on the inside the mast waiting to
catch an unsuspecting mouse and so it took probably 30
minutes and much jiggling before it finally made it to the bottom. It was
with a huge sense of relief that I fished out the mousing line
attached it to the halyard, but that was only half the job done. We then
had to gently pull the halyard back up through the mast on the
mousing line, and at one point it got stuck and refused to go any higher.
We jiggled it around for around 5 minutes and then suddenly it
was free, and a few minutes later Jacob shouted down triumphantly that he
had it in his hand.

Having got Jacob down and tidied all the bits away, we then set about
hoisting the Blue Water Runner on the new halyard. There was
very little wind but as we hoisted it we saw that one of the sheets was
caught around the wrong side of the forestay. The Blue Water
Runner sensed our hesitation and took the opportunity to leap into the sea
again (I can't really blame it, it was so hot yesterday I also
jumped into the sea at one point). We wrestled it back on deck, got it into
a neat roll and repeated the orange wool trick that worked so
effectively before. This time it went up perfectly, and, with just enough
wind to fill it, we had a peaceful night accompanied by the gentle
chuckle of the water going past the hull and the occasional flap from the
sail as the wind shifted.
