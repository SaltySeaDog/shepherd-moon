Well we made it, or we've very nearly made it. We are 
within a stone's throw of St Lucia (or at least a stone 
thrown by anyone other than the current crew of Shepherd 
Moon. The throwing gene seems to have gone awry in this 
family, and a well aimed stone is as likely to head for 
Cape Verde as St Lucia).  With a pod of dolphins helping 
shepherd us towards port, we just have to gybe the genoa 
and head for the finishing line. What could possibly go 
wrong! At least we don't have to give too much thought as 
to which sails to use for our approach. We've broken all 
the other options and so the genoa it is.

Yesterday the wind was mostly kind and we made good 
progress throughout the day. Jacob was starting to show 
clear signs of cabin fever but it was too rolly to send 
him up the mast and so we opted to play cards instead. 
Shepherd Moon thought that was a great idea and joined in 
enthusiastically, waiting until mid-game to slide the deck 
of cards off the cockpit table and onto the floor. Perhaps 
for the next leg we should find games that are less 
reliant on stable surfaces (as an aside, I was once on a 
drilling rig with a pool table. All the balls used to lie 
neatly against one cushion or the other and you had to 
time your shot to coincide with the few short seconds it 
would take the balls to transit between the two. Needless 
to say I was useless).

Anyway, only seven miles to go and Daisy is waiting on the 
pontoon to catch our ropes (or, more accurately, lines). It will be great to have the 
family back together again.
