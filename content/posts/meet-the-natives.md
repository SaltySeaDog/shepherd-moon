Life has been a bit hectic this past couple of weeks: fixing things that have been broken, 
provisioning for the next leg, making sure we have enough fuel and gas. Things always take 
much longer on a boat and there never seems to be enough time.  But it's not all been work 
and no play. Whilst we were on the Caribbean side of Panama waiting to transit the canal, we 
spent a day visiting an Embera Indian village. 

While we are short of time, it appears the Embera are short of clothes. After a 45-minute bus 
journey we were dropped off by the side of a large lake. There we were met by a group of 
lithe, loincloth clothed Indians. Poor Vanessa didn't know where to look. We wobbled our 
way into giant, outboard-motor-powered, dugout canoes and raced across the lake and up a 
river. Those unfortunate enough to get front row seats were quickly soaked. The jungle rose 
steeply on either side of the river forming a stunning backdrop to our journey, while 
overhead, eagles and ospreys swooped and soared.

When we arrived at the Embera village we were led into a large, open-sided, thatched-roof 
building.  On three sides tables were set up with baskets and woodcarvings. Although the 
Embera still live a traditional lifestyle, for the three months of the year when the river is high 
enough, they host tourist visits, selling handicrafts to fund secondary schooling for their 
children. The Embera ladies wear skirts and beads and that's pretty much it, and so it was 
mine and Jacob's turn to stare bashfully at our shoes. This becomes all the more challenging 
when the lady in question is holding out an beautiful woven basket for you to admire.

We were served a wonderful lunch of freshly caught river fish and fried plantain, served in 
an intricately folded banana leaf, after which we were taken on walk through the jungle by 
the medicine man. He showed us lots of different leaves use for various aliments, including 
having us try a leaf to cure toothache which tasted vile but did numb all sensation in your 
mouth. Although chopping our way through the jungle was interesting, the highlight of the 
walk was seeing our first sloth, high up in a tree, silhouetted against the blue sky.

The day ended with a dancing demonstration, at the end of which we were individually 
hauled out of the audience to join in. It was more of a shuffle-in-a-circle rather than proper 
dancing, which at least meant the embarrassment level was limited to the mismatch in 
clothing. Just before we left, the whole village turned out to be photographed. Our guide 
encouraged us to join the group but no one moved. Somebody had to lead the way and so I 
went and stood in the middle. It took a minute or so before anyone else joined me, and that 
minute was painfully awkward. As Jacob pointed out later, if you plotted the level of 
awkwardness against the number of white people posing with a village-full of half-naked 
Embera Indians, there is a very high peak at one!
