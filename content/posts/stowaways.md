In the early hours of this morning we finally arrived in the Galapagos and now we are leaving 
them again. Despite having Shepherd Moon lifted out of the water in Shelter Bay and 
pressure washed, and then checked again while we were in Las Perlas (albeit through murky 
green waters) we have acquired a few baby barnacles during our 1,000 mile transit from Las 
Perlas to the Galapagos. I had meant to check the bottom before we arrived, but the last 
couple of days haven't played out in the quite the way we expected. The net result is that the 
barnacle police told us (and the other two boats they checked today) to go 40 miles offshore 
to clean off the offending crustaceans, and then return to the anchorage for a further 
inspection. Oh well, it's a nice day for a sail.

The trip down to the Galapagos involved crossing the doldrums - the area straddling the 
equator and sitting between the northeast and southeast trades. Winds in the doldrums are 
typically light, with frequent squalls bringing extended periods of rain. All in all, pretty 
miserable sailing weather. We experienced both of these aspects. We had enough rain to 
discover that a couple of hatches are still prone to leaking, and we ended up motoring for 
over 50 hours during the course of the week because the wind died away to a mere zephyr. 
On the plus side, we did fly the Blue Water Runner for an extended period and it behaved 
impeccably; no broken halyards, no wild leaps into the sea.

Unfortunately, we were the last boat in the fleet to arrive (at least of those that set off at the 
same time. In fact one boat that left two days after us were just 30 miles behind by the time 
we closed the islands).  I blame this tardiness on Shepherd Moon's more traditional lines 
compared to the more modern, sleeker designs of the majority of the fleet.  Vanessa and 
Jacob, however, hold me solely responsible. Blaming my choice of strategy (head south until 
the wind stops and then turn right - all very scientific) on our late arrival. I have noticed a bit 
of boat envy creeping in amongst the crew. We have been invited on-board a couple of 
catamarans over the past few weeks and I have noticed Vanessa gazing longingly at the huge 
galleys, with microwaves, bread makers and coffee machines sitting happily on work tops 
rather than being lashed down or hidden away. As we were eating the obligatory pancakes 
on Shrove Tuesday (beautifully tossed, despite the heavy swell), I asked Vanessa what she 
was planning to give up for lent. Without a moments hesitation she said Mono-hulls!
