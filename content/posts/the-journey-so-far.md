The countdown to the departure across the atlantic has begun. There is just 6 days to go before we set off on the first proper leg of our adventure. All three of us are now in Las Palmas working through the to do list, attending seminars and filling the boat with enough food to feed a small army. There is a surreal bubble around Las Palmas with around 70 boats all raiding the local chandlers for missing bits of kit and deciding how much vaccum packed meat to get delivered from the local butcher. So with a bit of time on our hands it 

We picked up the newly christed *Shepherd Moon* from the island of Elos at the beginning of July, just as the whole of Sweden headed off for a long summer break. The boat looked beauitful but there were several items that were not working as they should. So with the bare minimum of instraments working Richard and I headed for the Hamble.We where dreadding braving the North Sea but in fact the worst weather was off Dover. To say it was hairy was an understatement. 

We then spent a few weeks getting various leaks, electronics and metalwork sorted before we finally departed the Hamble on the 7th August to northern Spain. A relatively benign crossing stopping ovrrnihht in Roscoff and Ousant before crossing the bay of Biscay. This was our first voyage out into the Atlantic ovean and also the first time we saw Pilot Whales. A bit of coast hopping down the coast of Spain and Portugal before we stopped at Lagosh for 6 weeks whilst Richard went back to work. A quick hop over to the Canaries and we were at the start line for thr begining of our adventure. Lets see what the next few years hold.
