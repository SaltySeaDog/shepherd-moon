**Sunday** : We spent the morning finishing off the final jobs on the boat. The last job on the list was a visit to the fishing tackle shop 
which was sadly closed, so no fresh fish for dinner for a while. At lunchtime we slipped our mooring and headed for the ARC+ start line. 
Quite a send off, loud music playing and a small crowd cheering and blowing horns from the harbour wall. It really sank home that after 
three years of planning we were finally on our way. We opted to cross the line in the middle of the fleet; too many miles to cover to risk 
damaging the boat in the melee at the front of the pack. Quite a sight to see 70 boats all heaviily laden with provisions, dreams and 
expectations, all heading out in the same direction. The 20 - 25 knot winds and confused sea made for a baptism of fire after the relative 
tranquility of marina life. We had a slightly uncomfortable night, with two of three of us looking slightly green around the gills. It will take a 
couple of days to get our sea legs back.
**Monday** : Amazing how quickly the fleet spreads out; 24 hours in and there's not another boat in sight - perhaps we're going the wrong 
way! We're sailing dead downwind at 6 to 8 knots, depending on the size of the wave we're surfing down. We've crossed paths with a 
couple of cargo boats and fishing boats as we approached the African coast. We've had a couple of baby squid leap onto the  deck but 
they don't seem to have worked out how to leap back, unfortunately. Calamari for tea!
**Tuesday**: Good news, the sea sickness patches are working and the seas have calmed. The bad news is the wind has dropped and 
so we're not charging along quite as fast as we have been. I think we're paying the price for the five super market trips we did in Las 
Palmas. There isn't a corner of the boat that isn't stuffed full of tins, weighing us down. It's a beautiful day; blue sky, fluffy white clouds 
and a very blue sea. We're now about 260 miles from Las Palmas and have 606 miles to go to Cape Verde. At the current rate we should 
be there by Saturday or Sunday, all being well. Breaking news, we've just been joined by a pod of dolphins. I think they are camera shy 
because in the time it took Jacob to dig out the camera, they'd disappeared. Or it may have been Richard's attempt at speaking dolphin 
to them!
