Yesterday started with a quick trip to the foredeck in the pitch black to
re-tether the infamous Blue Water Runner. The ropes that hold the
bottom of the sail to the furling chord had worn through and so it was
impossible to furl the sail away. The sail was also working its way
gradually up the furling chord, which was surprising given the sails
affinity with the sea. Thankfully the wind was light enough that I could
run some new lines to re-tether the sail.

I went back to sleep and woke to the sound of rain beating down on the
hatches. For those of you in the grips of a UK winter that may
not sound that surprising, but here in the land of endless blue skies and
stifling heat it is a little unusual. We had been caught by a squall
and when we turned on the radar you could see a long line of them stretched
out across the screen, each one showing up as an
ominous red blob. As dawn broke you could see that a slate grey,
flat-bottomed cloud matched each red blob on the screen - the
wonders of technology. Normally you would avoid squalls because they are
associated with strong winds, but its all relative. The 10 knot
increase in windspeed is a welcome boon when the background breeze is just
5 to 6 knots. The downside is that once the squall has
passed the wind drops away altogether. By mid-morning we found ourselves
encircled by squalls, with the wind switching to the west
rather than the east. We were heading back to Cape Verde! Albeit slowly.

The rest of the fleet seemed to be finding better wind to the south and
with no annoying squalls and so we decided to abandon the
rhumb line (the line of shortest distance between Cape Verde and St. Lucia)
and follow suit. With no wind we had to resort to the engine
and so motored for an hour until the wind picked up. That set the pattern
for the day. Twice more we had to resort to short periods of
motoring to find the wind, but once the wind picked up to around 6 knots we
could start sailing again. With the Blue Water Runner safely
stowed down below, we enjoyed an uneventful day of sailing under gennaker,
with a passing butterfly proving the most excitement. The
peace was briefly broken by the sound of a spray can down below. My first
thought was that Maverick was back and that Vanessa had
resorted to chemical warfare, but thankfully it was just the sound of the
polish can. The lack of drama outside the boat had driven
Vanessa to buff up the mahogany inside. Her enthusiasm for spring-cleaning
has continued into this morning and I fear Jacob and I are
next in line to be polished.
