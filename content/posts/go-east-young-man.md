Great trivia fact: to go from the Atlantic to the Pacific via the Panama Canal actually involves 
going east rather than west. We have done a fair number of locks in the past, but these have 
mostly been in France. The etiquette there is to rev up your engine and charge for the lock 
gates the second they open. Those unwilling to incur bumps and scratches to their boat may 
choose to hang back, but you then risk missing the lock altogether. And just being at the front 
for the next lock means nothing. I'm not sure there's even a word for queuing in French.

Thankfully the situation in Panama could not be more different; every second of the transit is 
choreographed in fine detail. It all starts with a visit by an admeasurer whose primary job it 
is to measure the length of your boat. The key here is to be less than 50 feet. Shepherd Moon 
is probably 49' 6 by the time you take into account the overhang of the anchor at the front 
and the assorted bits and bobs that stick out at the back, but if the admeasurer chose to take 
his tape over the top of the hard top rather than through the middle, that would probably 
add on 6 and cost us another US$500. Thankfully we had a kindly admeasurer, he even 
asked me to hold the end of the tape! It was certainly worth plying him with our very 
precious, homemade fruitcake. The admeasurer also checks that you have all the right safety 
equipment, and, more randomly, clean loos with hand soap for the advisor who will be 
travelling with you.

On the day of departure you are issued with big heavy ropes to secure you to the lock sides 
and equally beefy fenders to protect the boat should the scary lock walls come too close. We 
were to go through the lock in nests of 2 or 3 (we were lucky enough to be rafted with a 
catamaran, Smoke and Roses, whose skipper, apart from being an ex fireman, is used to 
manoeuvring large barges!) We all waited with baited breath to be given the signal to leave 
the marina and head for a holding area to collect our advisor. 

As far as we can tell the advisors job is to eat your food, check his mobile phone, and give 
odd bits of advise which are usually contrary to that being given by the advisors on the other 
boats. Thankfully, the demands of our advisor were none too arduous. One boat offered their 
advisor toast and cereal, only to be told that he was on a special diet that required him to 
have bacon, eggs, hash browns and sausages for breakfast (where have I gone wrong? I ask 
for that most mornings but haven't seen a cooked breakfast since the middle of the Atlantic. 
Perhaps I need to break the freezer!).

Then the word went out to move to the locks and raft up, no mean feat when the wind is 
blowing you towards the locks at 3 knots and you have huge boats to keep clear of. We were 
transiting via the old set of locks, built just over a hundred years ago and still working 
perfectly. The lock gates towered above us and made us feel very small. To give an idea of 
size, the previous day we had watched the Queen Elizabeth cruise ship go through the same 
lock with just inches to spare either side.

Once in the locks, the main danger is from flying monkey fists (a knot ball on the end of a thin 
line, designed to give it sufficient weight to throw), which overtime have become rock-hard. 
The first one slammed into the boom about six inches from my head. Once retrieved, the thin 
line is tied to our borrowed heavy line, which is hauled back to the shore and dropped over a 
bollard. The big boats are moved within the locks by mules, or little trains, but for the little 
boats like us, each raft is walked through by four lock-men, rather like taking a giant, floating 
hound for a walk. 

Once the heavy lines are secured, the real work starts for the line-handlers (in our case, 
Vanessa and Jacob). It is their job to take up the slack as the boats rise (or let the rope out as 
it falls), whilst trying to keep the raft more-or-less in the middle of the lock. This is far harder 
than it sounds, given the swirling currents created by the water flooding into the lock. It takes 
three locks to raise you to the level of Gatun Lake, which is 85 metres above sea level, and 
thankfully we managed to negotiate all three without incident. We got through the last of the 
locks as night fell.

At dawn the following morning we were awoken by the howl of howler monkeys from the 
jungle on the banks of the lake, and shortly afterwards we were re-joined by our friendly 
advisors. Thankfully our advisor had already breakfasted and so instead he focused on 
keeping us in the right channel as we navigated the 30 or so miles across the lake towards 
the Miraflores locks. Usually this is done at great speed, but, for whatever reason, our 
advisors seemed to want to spin out their day of boating and so we spent a lot of time just 
drifting with the wind (not sailing, that's not allowed) across the lake. 

As approached the Gaillard Cut, tensions began to rise. Our advisor was telling us to go to the 
left of the channel, while boss advisor on Smoke and Roses was telling him to move to the 
right and the trainee advisor on our boat was saying to go backwards! And then, after nearly 
9 hours of going as slowly as we possibly could, we were told to race at full speed towards 
the lock as a tanker was coming up close behind.

As we went though the Miraflores locks we spent a lot of time waving into space hoping to be 
seen by the lock webcam. Jacob was in touch with family at home who were directing us 
where to look. It made it all the more special to think that friends and family at home were 
watching, although from the screen shots we saw, you could hardly make out which yacht 
was Shepherd Moon, let alone identify the cavorting crew on the deck (Jacob insisted on 
doing a sloth impression from the boom). As we left the final lock and headed under the 
iconic Bridge of the Americas, the sun was setting to the west and a huge full moon was rising 
to the east. It was a fitting welcome to the Pacific and the next leg of our adventure.
