For those of you following the YB tracker, you can see that we're on the move again. Our all 
too brief visit to Colombia surpassed even our high expectations. The country is vibrant, the 
people are lovely and it's ridiculously cheap. Most of our time was spent doing minor repairs 
and re-stocking the food cupboards, but we did manage to take a trip up the mountain to visit 
a coffee plantation. Jacob and I also visited a local barber's shop. Just in case you ever find 
yourself sitting in a barber's chair in Colombia, it's worth noting that numero dos doesn't 
translate quite as you might expect. In fairness to the barber, he did double check, but only 
after he'd cut a razor-width swathe around the side of my head, reducing it to the kind of 
stubble most men could grow overnight (not me, I hasten to add. I once tried to grow a beard 
and it took weeks before anyone even noticed my efforts).

I'm not sure if there was still too much caffeine in my system from the trip up the mountain, 
or whether I was trying to make up for being three days late arriving, but we made a 
complete hash of the start for this leg. The sun was shining and there was just the gentlest of 
breezes ruffling the surface of the water, and so ignoring the forecast, I decided that the 
conditions were perfect for the gennaker. It didn't take long for the conditions to become 
anything but perfect, and so with Shepherd Moon leaning over at an alarming angle, we 
sheepishly rolled it away again, hoping that no one had noticed our huge blue and turquoise 
sail. 

The rest of the trip has been largely uneventful. Strong winds and big seas giving way to 
more manageable conditions before the strong winds returned, this time with thunderstorms 
for company. With flashes of sheet lightning all around, Vanessa bundled the laptops into the 
oven. I'm not sure if it really offers that much protection from a strike, but it keeps them 
toasty.

Yesterday afternoon we were trundling along with just the genoa out when we were called 
by another boat, warning us they were about to overtake on our port side. I had been feeling 
sick all morning and, as a result, lethargic but this was a call to arms. The wind had dropped 
sufficiently to break out our beloved Blue Water Runner. We had re-run the new dyneema 
halyard whilst in Santa Marta and so it was renewed confidence that we hoisted it up and let 
the two halves unfurl. Or partially unfurl. We had managed to loop one of the two sheets 
around the wrong side of the sail, and so our racing sail change turned into a reverse-
knitting exercise. With the knot undone, the sail filled and we were on our way. We kept the 
sail up until the early hours of this morning, in winds of between 15 and 20 knots. Even when 
it reached 25 knots the sail still coped, driving Shepherd Moon along at between 8 to 9 knots. 
The first mate's nerves were coping less well, however, and so with 15 miles to go to the 
finishing line, we furled the sail and got it safely down below. No broken halyards, and no 
leaps into the sea. 

As it turned out, it was a great decision. Each boat had been asked to predict their finishing 
time before the start, and we had guessed 07:00:00. For a while it looked as though we might 
be early, but with just the genoa up and the wind dropping away occasionally, we had to 
drive really hard for the line, eventually crossing at 07:00:30. We are now tucked up in an 
idyllic anchorage, surrounded by small islands, thick with palm trees and fringed with white 
sand beaches. At least it would be idyllic if we hadn't bought a dose of UK weather with us. 
It's misty, raining and grey. Hopefully the sun will come out to play tomorrow. It's only a day 
away, after all.
