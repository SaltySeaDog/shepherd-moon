Thankfully the Equatorial current is very forgiving and hasn't gone off in a sulk just because 
we called it by the wrong name in yesterday's blog. It has continued to whisk us along 
westwards at a couple of knots, helping us achieve a noon-to-noon run of 179 nautical miles. 
The sea has lost the glorious electric blue of the mid-Atlantic and is now more grey-blue, with 
splashes of white where the waves over steepen and tumble in on themselves. It's still very 
beautiful in it's own way.

The big news from yesterday is that Jacob and I had showers and so we are both squeaky 
clean. That also meant new pants for me, this time with a rather fetching maroon waste band 
that happens to match the maroon belt on my sailing shorts. Perhaps I took a little too much 
pleasure in my colour-coordinated clothing because at suppertime I managed to pour half a 
can of beer all over my lap. A quick spray down and then it was back to my all-weather jim-
jams for the rest of the evening. Hopefully tomorrow will bring something more interesting 
to write about. I guess we could always hoist the Blue Water Runner!
