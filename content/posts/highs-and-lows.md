The past 24 hours have been a bit of a rollercoaster, perfectly
encompassing the highs and lows of sailing. On the plus side, yesterday
was shower day, and it provided one of those moments that make this trip so
memorable. I was standing (or hunched, would be more
accurate) in the shower, looking out of the window at the bluest of blue
seas as a shoal of flying fish skimmed past the boat. They must
have travelled a good 50 metres or so before plunging into a wave, with the
sun on their scales giving each one a sparkling iridescence.
It was magical.

That brief moment of pleasure now seems an eternity away. Our prayers for
more wind were answered in abundance and we spent the
evening charging along at around 7 knots. I was on watch around midnight
when there was a loud bang. I was gazing at the night sky
behind the boat at the time and when Vanessa called up from the cabin below
to ask what it was, I said I thought we'd just slammed into
a large wave. But when I turned round and looked at the instruments I saw
we were only doing 2 knots, and when I looked at where our
sail should be there was just an empty space full of stars. The halyard
holding the top of the sail had worn threw (or been chewed through
by the still elusive "Maverick") and the sail was floating on the sea.
After a bit of a struggle, we managed to man handle it onto the deck
and then tried to hoist it on a spare halyard, but it got in a tangle and
fell into the sea again (I fear our Blue Water Runner may be taking
its name a little too literally). Once more we wrestled it out of the water
although this time it brought with it bucketfuls of water and a teeny
fish (which Richard subsequently sat on). We decided to deal with it in the
daylight and so lashed the sail to the guardrail and gave it a
firm talking to about which element it was designed for, and that we still
had the receipt if it continued to misbehave. We then spent the
rest of the night creeping along under a poled out genoa and our very small
staysail. All those miles we'd gained on the fleet gradually
slipping away.
